# Real-time-traffic-monitoring-and-management-system

This project is a traffic lane vehicle detection system powered by YOLOv8 and OpenCV. It detects vehicles in predefined lanes and a ring area, counts them, and provides live visual feedback. The system is designed for real-time analysis in traffic monitoring applications.

## Features

- **YOLOv8-based vehicle detection** for high accuracy.
- **Lane-based and ring-area vehicle counting**:
  - Incoming lanes: Default color is blue.
  - Outgoing lanes: Default color is green.
  - Active areas: Highlighted in red.
- **Real-time vehicle tracking**:
  - Increment and decrement logic for accurate counts.
  - Displays counts for each lane and the ring area.
- **Dynamic visualization**:
  - Lanes and ring areas change colors based on activity.
  - Count overlays displayed for quick analysis.
